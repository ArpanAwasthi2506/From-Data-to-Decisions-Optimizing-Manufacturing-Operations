# From-Data-to-Decisions-Optimizing-Manufacturing-Operations

Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging data analytics to enhance manufacturing processes and operational efficiency. Key activities include data preprocessing, developing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and creating interactive dashboar using Power BI. MySQL queries were used for database interactions to extract and analyze data effectively. A final presentation summarizes the findings and provides actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
